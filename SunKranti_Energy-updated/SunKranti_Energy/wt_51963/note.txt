Hi Sir/Ma'am,

I am working for an IT company and got an option to work from home. For some urgent work I came to Jabalpur (my home town) and got stuck here. Since my assets are in nagpur (in-laws home) I am not able to manage my work. I applied for epass (token: NAG04022014012186,NAG03412059302286) and got approved also, but because of today's circular Mr. Sagar Sir (Ph. no 9325492295) said that he cannot give it now.
I request you to please allow me to go back so that I can resume my work properly.

Note: If I'll be allowed to come back, my husband Mr. Avtar Patel will come to pick me by vehicle number  MH 49 U 8891 along with driver (Satish).

Contact details:
Avtar Patel (husband) Phone Number: 7410597916, 9561432924
Tripti Patel Phone Number: 7415386536, 7999614170
Nagpur address: Plot no. 168/A binaki, Bharat wadi lalganj, ward number 42.
                            Nagpur-440004. Maharashtra.
Jabalpur address: Plot no. 101/3A sai colony, deendayal chowk, jabalpur-                                        482002 M.P.
